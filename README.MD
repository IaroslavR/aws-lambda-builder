### Docker image for build AWS Lambdas

Base helper image for build and test AWS lambda packages without EC2 instances

##### Why? We are already have [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html)

Answer: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli/issues/973

##### Requirements
- Docker
- docker-compose

#### Usage
- Copy your code and `requirements.txt` to the `./src` dir
- Execute `make build-package`

Results can be found in `./.build`(sources + libs) and in `./.package`(ready to use zipped lambda) dirs. Python version and other globals can be modified in `.env` file

#### Available commands
 ```
$ make

Usage:
  make <target>

Targets:
  help        Display this help
  build-image  Build builder Docker image
  delete-image  Remove docker image
  push-image  Push image to the regestry
  clean       Clean dirs
  build-package  Build lambda package
```
